# ------------
# 1. Added Comments above
# 2. I didn't make any mistakes this time.
# 3. I don't use paper, but I'll create a file called mistakes.txt to track them.
# 4 & 5 These are good things to remember. When you go to the next exercise, look at the 
# mistakes you have made and try not to make them in this new one. Remember that everyone 
# makes mistakes. Programmers are like magicians who fool everyone into thinking they are 
# perfect and never wrong, but it's all an act. They make mistakes all the time.
